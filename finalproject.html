    <h1> Blackjack </h1>
    <p>My final project this year was blackjack. I knew that I wanted to make a game and decided that blackjack would use a lot of the ideas that we went over in the class. I learned much from the project in terms of patience and figuring out how to problem solve efficiently as well as communicate with my partner. Feel free to play my game below and have fun!</p>
